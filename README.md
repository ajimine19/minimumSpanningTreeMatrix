# minimumSpanningTreeMatrix 
# Also included is a hashtable
The following code produces a minimum spanning tree matrix that takes in an input file and print the new matrix in an output. We created a batch file that takes in every name and value and saves it in a series of nodes with a hash table. After, prim function is called to sort out the matrix and come out with mst. Inside of prim there is a minimum function that replaces the value if it the min is less than the value. printing uses nest for loops to through all the variables to switch from 0 to a edgeweight value if neccessary.
